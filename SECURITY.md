# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest version is always the only one supported. It is the one that is in GitHub Releases, and published on Google Play. 
Whenever there is a newer version, you should update. However, due to the nature of how the app approaches data storage, nothing should "break", if you don't update, you may just miss out on some features. 
There are no services depending on an external API, in which a change could break the app.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Due to the fact that the app stores everything in local storage, vulnerabilities of any kind should never appear. However, if you happen to find some vulnerability, you should create an Issue, and describe it with the "Vulnerability" tag.
If such issue is created, it is treated with the highest priority, and a patch will be released as soon as possible.
